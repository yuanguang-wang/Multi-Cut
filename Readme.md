# Multi-Cut
## General
### - Introduction
Multi-Cut is a Rhino Plugin that mimics the behavior of the Multi-Cut Function in Autodesk Maya,
providing basically all core features of the original Maya version.
### - System Requirement
Rhino 7.0 and later, Windows 10/11. <br/>
Support MacOS partly*.<br/>
### - Tutorial
Here is a youtube video about how to use this plugin if you don't want to read the heavy text below.<br/>
[《 Manual of the Multi-Cut Plugin for Rhino 》](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Instillation
### - via Package Manager
- Open *Rhino*
- In the Command Window, type the command ```PackageManager```
- In the popped up *Package Manager* window, search ***Multi-Cut***

## Commands
Multi-Cut Plugin has two commands: ```mct``` and ```mcp```
### - mct
```mct``` stands for multi-cut.
### - mcp
```mcp``` stands for multi-cut preference. 

## Anatomy - ```mcp```
By typing ```mcp``` in the commandline, the "Multi-Cut Preference" window will show up. 
The behavior of entire multi-cut operation could be changed through this window, including **- General -, - About -, - Assistant Line -, - Assistant Point -, - Prediction Line -**.

### - General -
Settings placed here are the settings don't belong to any of the specific sub-category.
##### Split When Possible /  Keep Brep Joined

When the cutting polyline is closed in 3D, it is possible to split the Brep in two (or more) pieces.
By checking this, the Brep will be split if the cutting polyline is closed. 
However, if the cutting line/polyline is not closed, even checked will not split the Brep.

### - Customization -
Multi-Cut Plugin uses specific colors to highlight the current operation and show what kind operation is executing, 
as well as the specific point size and line width. 
If not designated, the default color is set by the Plugin's built in settings, and the point size and line width is following the user's current display mode setting.

#

### - Assistant Line -
Assistant Line is a bundle of pre-drawn lines which are common used in modelling, including iso-curve of the surface, 
the work plane (aka CPlane) intersections, and the world plane (aka world coordinates) intersections. 
When enabled, pre-drawn lines will show up on the surface which is going to be cut,
with a paired end point that could be picked as a selection of its paired line.

##### Enabled /  Disabled
Open / Close the "Assistant Line" feature.
##### Intersection - IsoCurve
##### Intersection - CPlane
##### Intersection - World Plane

#

### - Assistant Point -
Assistant Points divide the current selected edge by the number that user set. 

##### Enabled /  Disabled
Open / Close the "Assistant Line" feature.
##### Division Number
Number set here will slice the current Brep edge by its value, supports from 2 to 20.

#

### - Prediction Line - 
Not like ***Assistant Line*** which is pre-drawn by Plugin, ***Prediction Line*** is the line generated by a plane and the selected Brep, which means, 
the ***Prediction Line*** is an intersection of a special plane and a selected Brep. 
In different cut operation phase, the plane will adjust according to the cut point, 
and up to 3 points ( a plane that formed by 3 points). Following scenarios will focus on the plane which generates the ***Prediction Line***
<br/>
<br/>
***Cut Point = 1:***
<br/>
The plane will be defined by Origin: current cut point, Z-Axis: the tangent line on the current edge at the current point.

***Cut Point = 2:***
<br/>
The plane will be defined by Origin: current cut point, Vector 1: (current point - last point), Vector 2: World Axis-X


***Cut Point = 3:***
<br/>
The plane will be defined by 3 points that just picked from the cut operation beginning.
